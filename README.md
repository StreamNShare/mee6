NOTE: This only words with Python 3.5 or later, but we will use Python 3.5. **DOES NOT WORK WITH PYTHON 2 OR PYTHON 3.4**

We will be using Ubuntu 14 for this tutorial, but linux systems that use `apt` package manager like Mint, CentOS, Debian, and Raspbian should work fine.

There's nothing wrong with using a virtual machine.

You can install automatically or manually, see below.
# Manual installation

Install python3, pip3, redis, and nginx:

`apt install python3 python3-pip redis-server nginx`

Then, discord.py:

`python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py/archive/async.zip#egg=discord.py[voice]`

The next thing we need to do is clone this repo from github:

`git clone https://github.com/jtagt/mee6/`

Then, we need `pip` to install the necessary packages for the website script and the chat script. First, we will install for the website script:

`cd mee6/website && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then we will do the same command, but for the chat script:

`cd ../chat-bot && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

# Automatic Installation
Download `install.sh` from this repo.

Use `chmod` to make the installer executable:


`chmod 755 install.sh`

Then run it:

`./install.sh`

You can then remove it with:

`rm install.sh`.

# Alias Config
Now that all the dependencies are installed we can move onto confgiuring some of the variables.

export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost

export OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=Discord client ID for your bot

export OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=your Discord bot's client secret

export MEE6_TOKEN=Your Discord bot token

export OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/confirm_login (change to your domain if needed.)

export MAL_USERNAME=username for account on http://myanimelist.net

export MAL_PASSWORD=password for above site

export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=client ID for a twitch app

export GOOGLE_API_KEY=a youtube api key

export SECRET_KEY=1111 ***Change to a longer code, preferably longer than this***

If you are fine with not having some features work, simply remove the variable value and leave the empty assignment.

Now do:

`cd ~ && nano .bashrc`

Press Control-V to go to the end of the document (don't remove anything), and paste in these variables. Save and exit.
(To exit, press Control-X, then Y then Enter.)

# Website Config

We need to proxy behing nginx to access the site from a mobile device (where browsers don't allow `localhost` links). To do so, we need to edit the nginx config file included in the `nginx` package, which you either installed manually or with the installer.

First remove the default enabled sites on nginx:

`rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

Then create it again:

`nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

Then paste in (no, nothing wrong with example.com):
```
server {
        listen 80;
        server_name www.example.com example.com;
        root /var/www/html/;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/;
            include /etc/nginx/proxy_params;
        }

    }
```
Now save and exit.
(To exit, press Control-X, then Y then Enter.)

Now restart the `nginx` service:
`service nginx restart`

Now, the dashboard is accessible at your internal ip address, which should be something like `192.168.1.xx` or `192.168.x.xx`.

To make it accessable to the outside world you must port forward. Visit this website for help on port fowarding:

https://portforward.com/router.htm

If you have a domain you can use Cloudflare, point your domain at your IP address, and update the config file to host the dashboard on a public domain!


# Running Mee6

To smooth out the booting process, reboot your machine at this point. If you don't, the aliases set in `.bashrc` will not work, and the scripts will error out. So reboot.

Login as `root` on boot:
sudo -i

Then start the bot, go to your mee6 repo location:

`cd ~/mee6/chat-bot/ && python3 bot.py`

Open another instance of Terminal (login as root there too), navigate to the mee6 folder, and execute this python file to start the website:

`cd ~/mee6/website/ && python3 app.py`

Do note that you may have to reboot after closing the website so that it works again, 
as python does not automatically unbind fron the domain.

# Conclusion

Sadly, I am unable to find enough source code to make everything work, but I do my best!
If you find any issues please feel free to open an issue!
PLEASE NOTE: Not all features may work as this repo is in the process of being updated.
